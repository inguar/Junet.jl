## Graph type definition ##

"""
    Graph{N,E,D,M}

Type for storing graphs. Its fields have mostly self-explanatory names
(field marked with an asterisk is for internal use only):

* `nodes`      — vector with nodes in the graph
* `nodeattrs`  — dictionary with node attributes
* `edgemaxid`* — largest edge id
* `edgecount`  — count of edges in the graph
* `edgeattrs`  — dictionary with edge attributes

There are four type parameters:

* `N` — integer type used for node ids
* `E` — integer type used for edge ids, `Nothing` can also be used to save space
* `D` — singleton type indicating whether the graph is directed
    - `Directed`   — directed graph (default)
    - `Undirected` — undirected graph
* `M` — singleton type indicating whether multiple edges and self-loops
are allowed
    - `Multi`  — multiple edges and self-loops allowed, i.e. graph
    is a multigraph (default)
    - `Simple` — only single edges between pais of different nodes allowed,
    i.e. graph is simple

There is a couple of predefined type aliases you can use for dispatch in your
functions: `DirectedGraph` or `UndirectedGraph` (w.r.t graph directedness), and
`MultiGraph` or `SimpleGraph` (w.r.t. being a multigraph).
